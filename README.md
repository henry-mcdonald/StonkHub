 **Wireframes**
  - Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Whatever you use, get a screen cap.
  - Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.
  - Move your image files into the project folder and link them in your README. (You might want to put all your wireframe images into a single folder called images or assets. In that case you'll have to specify the filepath to those images including the containing folder.) Pro tip: use VScode's markdown previewer!
